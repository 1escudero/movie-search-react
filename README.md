# Movie Searcher App

I started this project in order to get more experience working with React's State/Prop, Map and Axios API request. The application uses TMDb open API to search for Movies, TV Shows and Celebrities, all components are reusables. To get a better looking I decided to use Semantic UI framework so I could quickly prototype my mockup. You can search for Movie titles, celebrities names or TV shows, all in three different languages (English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese). 

## Getting Started

Just download the project, request your API key on the TMDb's website: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api , change the API key inside the /api/key folder and run the project (npm start). * You need to have React/NPM installed * 

## Built With
